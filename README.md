# Portfolio
I am a senior IT student and am currently working to improve my resume by creating projects. I will primarily create an Resume that will highlight different projects I will be working on.

I will also make java projects (as I'm interested in Andriod App developement also).

I'm hoping to have my website up and running on github in the next few months.
